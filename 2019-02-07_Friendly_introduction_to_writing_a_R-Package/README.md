Have you ever moved house? Imagine moving your house one item  at  a time. Super painful! The better way is to put things in boxes where like things go together, and they are much easier to transport. 

Writing an R package is a similar thing. It’s the ideal way to transport and share your code. As Hilary Parker said in her famous blog post: “How to write an R package from scratch”: Seriously, it doesn’t have to be about sharing your code (although that is an added benefit!). It is about saving yourself time. (n.b. this is my attitude about all reproducibility.)

This workshop was designed to have people come out feeling that making an R package is useful and worthwhile learning.  

Speaker:

Nick Tierney recently completed his PhD in Statistics at QUT, and is now a Research Fellow in Statistics at Monash University in Australia, where he works with [Rob Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/ ) and [Di Cook](http://dicook.org/ ) in the NUMBAT group. Nick’s research aims to improve data analysis workflow. His work so far has focussed on the importance of knowing your data ( [`visdat`](https://github.com/njtierney/visdat) ), and on creating principles and tools that make it easier to work with, explore, and model missing data ( [`naniar`](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar)).

Nick loves the R programming language https://www.r-project.org/ and how it has transformed his world. He is a proud member of the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/ ) community, a collective that works to make science open using R, and co-host a podcast with [Saskia Freytag](https://twitter.com/trashystats ) about everything #rstats named ["Credibly Curious"](https://soundcloud.com/crediblycurious ).

Nick a keen rock climber, loves karaoke, and is a coffee geek.
